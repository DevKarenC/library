# Recipe Library

This project showcases a recipe library where you can save your favorite recipes. It is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. A third-party library called Sweet Alert was used to create an alert pop-up for users when deleting a recipe.

This recipe library can:

- [x] Offer you example recipes already added as part of the library
- [x] Add a recipe (name, time, difficulty, ingredients, link) of your own
- [x] Delete a recipe according to your need
- [x] Ask for confirmation when deleting a recipe
- [x] Let you save whether you have tried out the recipe or not
